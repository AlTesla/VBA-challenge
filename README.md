# VBA-challenge
this repository contains the VBA challenge, Data Analytics Bootcamp assignment

First I begin scripting with the  alphabetical_testing.xlsx, I was able to make the script run on all the sheets but it took 5 minutes to run,
then I was debugging the functions and trying to reduce interations and I got the time down to less that a minute so i thought it would work
with the Multiple_year_stock_daba.xlsx and I tried it, but it didn't work at all, i kept debugging and thinking algorithms to reduce iterations,
I found mathematical proportions that helped me find values with a menu and uni functions to give me a list of values, so I managed to reduce 
the time in which the code is executed to less than a minute.
